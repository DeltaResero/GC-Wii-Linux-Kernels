/*
 * Ticket locks are conceptually two parts, one indicating the current head of
 * the queue, and the other indicating the current tail. The lock is acquired
 * by atomically noting the tail and incrementing it by one (thus adding
 * ourself to the queue and noting our position), then waiting until the head
 * becomes equal to the the initial value of the tail.
 *
 * We use an xadd covering *both* parts of the lock, to increment the tail and
 * also load the position of the head, which takes care of memory ordering
 * issues and should be optimal for the uncontended case. Note the tail must be
 * in the high part, because a wide xadd increment of the low part would carry
 * up and contaminate the high part.
 *
 * With fewer than 2^8 possible CPUs, we can use x86's partial registers to
 * save some instructions and make the code more elegant. There really isn't
 * much between them in performance though, especially as locks are out of line.
