config CRC_CCITT
	tristate "CRC-CCITT functions"
	help
	  This option is provided for the case where no in-kernel-tree
	  modules require CRC-CCITT functions, but a module built outside
	  the kernel tree does. Such modules that use library CRC-CCITT
	  functions require M here.

config CRC16

	  This option is provided for the case where no in-kernel-tree
	  modules require CRC16 functions, but a module built outside
	  the kernel tree does. Such modules that use library CRC16
	  functions require M here.

config CRC_T10DIF
	tristate "CRC calculation for the T10 Data Integrity Field"
	help
	  This option is only needed if a module that's not in the
	  kernel tree needs to calculate CRC checks for use with the
	  SCSI data integrity subsystem.

config CRC_ITU_T

	help
	  This option is provided for the case where no in-kernel-tree

	  functions require M here.

config CRC32

	help
	  This option is provided for the case where no in-kernel-tree
	  modules require CRC32/CRC32c functions, but a module built outside
	  the kernel tree does. Such modules that use library CRC32/CRC32c
	  functions require M here.

config CRC32_SELFTEST
	bool "CRC32 perform self test on init"
	default n
	depends on CRC32
	help
	  This option enables the CRC32 library functions to perform a
	  self test on initialization. The self test computes crc32_le
	  and crc32_be over byte strings with random alignment and length
	  and computes the total elapsed time and number of bytes processed.

config CRC32_SLICEBY8
	bool "Slice by 8 bytes"
	help
	  Calculate checksum 8 bytes at a time with a clever slicing algorithm.
	  This is the fastest algorithm, but comes with a 8KiB lookup table.
	  Most modern processors have enough cache that this shouldn't be
	  a problem.

	  If you don't know which to choose, choose this one.

config CRC32_SLICEBY4
	bool "Slice by 4 bytes"
	help
	  Calculate checksum 8 bytes at a time with a clever slicing algorithm.
	  This is reasonably fast, but has a 4KiB lookup table.

config CRC32_SARWATE
	bool "Sarwate's Algorithm (one byte at a time)"
	help
	  Calculate checksum a byte at a time using Sarwate's algorithm.  This
	  is not particularly fast, but has a small 256 byte lookup table.

config CRC32_BIT
	bool "Classic Algorithm (one bit at a time)"
	help
	  Calculate checksum one bit at a time.  This is VERY slow, but has
	  no lookup table.  This is provided as a debugging option.

	  This option is provided for the case where no in-kernel-tree

	  This option is provided for the case where no in-kernel-tree
	  modules require CRC32c functions, but a module built outside the
	  kernel tree does. Such modules that use library CRC32c functions
	  require M here.  See Castagnoli93.
	  Module will be libcrc32c.
