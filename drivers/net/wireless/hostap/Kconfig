	---help---
	Shared driver code for IEEE 802.11b wireless cards based on
	Intersil Prism2/2.5/3 chipset. This driver supports so called
	Host AP mode that allows the card to act as an IEEE 802.11
	access point.

	See <http://hostap.epitest.fi/> for more information about the
	Host AP driver configuration and tools. This site includes
	information and tools (hostapd and wpa_supplicant) for WPA/WPA2
	support.

	This option includes the base Host AP driver code that is shared by
	different hardware models. You will also need to enable support for
	PLX/PCI/CS version of the driver to actually use the driver.

	The driver can be compiled as a module and it will be called
	"hostap.ko".

config HOSTAP_FIRMWARE

	depends on HOSTAP
	---help---
	Configure Host AP driver to include support for firmware image
	download. Current version supports only downloading to volatile, i.e.,
	RAM memory. Flash upgrade is not yet supported.

	Firmware image downloading needs user space tool, prism2_srec. It is
	available from http://hostap.epitest.fi/.
