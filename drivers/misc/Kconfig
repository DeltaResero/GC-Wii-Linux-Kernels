config GAMECUBE_GQR
	tristate "Device driver for Gamecube Gekko GQR"
	depends on GAMECUBE
	default m
	---help---
          This option enables device driver support for the Gekko processor's
          Graphic Quantization Registers.  These registers are used with the
          psql and psqst instrutions.  The registers will appear in
          /proc/sys/gqr.

config GAMECUBE_MI
	tristate "Nintendo GameCube Memory Interface"
	depends on GAMECUBE
	default n
	help
	  If you say yes to this option, support will be included for the
	  Memory Interface (MI) of the Nintendo GameCube.
	  
	  The MI allows one to setup up to four protected memory regions,
	  catching invalid accesses to them. The MI catches out of bounds
	  memory accesses too.
	  
	  If in doubt, say N here.

config IBM_ASM
	tristate "Device driver for IBM RSA service processor"
	depends on X86 && PCI && EXPERIMENTAL
	---help---
	  This option enables device driver support for in-band access to the
	  IBM RSA (Condor) service processor in eServer xSeries systems.
	  The ibmasm device driver allows user space application to access
	  ASM (Advanced Systems Management) functions on the service
	  processor. The driver is meant to be used in conjunction with
	  a user space API.
	  The ibmasm driver also enables the OS to use the UART on the
	  service processor board as a regular serial port. To make use of
	  this feature serial driver support (CONFIG_SERIAL_8250) must be
	  enabled.

	  WARNING: This software may not be supported or function
	  correctly on your IBM server. Please consult the IBM ServerProven
	  website <http://www.pc.ibm.com/ww/eserver/xseries/serverproven> for
	  information on the specific driver level and support statement
	  for your IBM server.


	  If unsure, say N.

config SGI_IOC4
	tristate "SGI IOC4 Base IO support"
	depends on PCI
	---help---
	  This option enables basic support for the IOC4 chip on certain
	  SGI IO controller cards (IO9, IO10, and PCI-RT).  This option
	  does not enable any specific functions on such a card, but provides
	  necessary infrastructure for other drivers to utilize.

	  If you have an SGI Altix with an IOC4-based card say Y.
	  Otherwise say N.

config TIFM_CORE
	tristate "TI Flash Media interface support (EXPERIMENTAL)"
	depends on EXPERIMENTAL
	help
	  If you want support for Texas Instruments(R) Flash Media adapters
	  you should select this option and then also choose an appropriate
	  host adapter, such as 'TI Flash Media PCI74xx/PCI76xx host adapter
	  support', if you have a TI PCI74xx compatible card reader, for
	  example.
	  You will also have to select some flash card format drivers. MMC/SD
	  cards are supported via 'MMC/SD Card support: TI Flash Media MMC/SD
	  Interface support (MMC_TIFM_SD)'.

          To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module will
	  be called tifm_core.

config TIFM_7XX1
	tristate "TI Flash Media PCI74xx/PCI76xx host adapter support (EXPERIMENTAL)"
	depends on PCI && TIFM_CORE && EXPERIMENTAL
	default TIFM_CORE
	help
	  This option enables support for Texas Instruments(R) PCI74xx and
	  PCI76xx families of Flash Media adapters, found in many laptops.
	  To make actual use of the device, you will have to select some
	  flash card format drivers, as outlined in the TIFM_CORE Help.

          To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module will
	  be called tifm_7xx1.

config MSI_LAPTOP
        tristate "MSI Laptop Extras"
        depends on X86
        depends on ACPI_EC
        depends on BACKLIGHT_CLASS_DEVICE
        ---help---
	  This is a driver for laptops built by MSI (MICRO-STAR
	  INTERNATIONAL):

	  MSI MegaBook S270 (MS-1013)
	  Cytron/TCM/Medion/Tchibo MD96100/SAM2000

	  It adds support for Bluetooth, WLAN and LCD brightness control.

	  More information about this driver is available at
	  <http://0pointer.de/lennart/tchibo.html>.

	  If you have an MSI S270 laptop, say Y or M here.
