config NETFILTER_NETLINK
       tristate "Netfilter netlink interface"
       help
         If this option is enabled, the kernel will include support

config NETFILTER_NETLINK_LOG
	tristate "Netfilter LOG over NFNETLINK interface"
	depends on NETFILTER_NETLINK
	help
	  If this option is enabled, the kernel will include support
	  for logging packets via NFNETLINK.

	  This obsoletes the existing ipt_ULOG and ebg_ulog mechanisms,
	  and is also scheduled to replace the old syslog-based ipt_LOG
	  and ip6t_LOG modules.

config NF_CONNTRACK
	tristate "Layer 3 Independent Connection tracking (EXPERIMENTAL)"
	depends on EXPERIMENTAL && IP_NF_CONNTRACK=n
	default n
	---help---
	  Connection tracking keeps a record of what packets have passed
	  through your machine, in order to figure out how they are related
	  into connections.

	  Layer 3 independent connection tracking is experimental scheme
	  which generalize ip_conntrack to support other layer 3 protocols.

	  To compile it as a module, choose M here.  If unsure, say N.

config NF_CT_ACCT
	bool "Connection tracking flow accounting"
	depends on NF_CONNTRACK
	help
	  If this option is enabled, the connection tracking code will

	  Those counters can be used for flow-based accounting or the
	  `connbytes' match.

	  If unsure, say `N'.

config NF_CONNTRACK_MARK
	bool  'Connection mark tracking support'
	depends on NF_CONNTRACK
	help
	  This option enables support for connection marks, used by the
	  `CONNMARK' target and `connmark' match. Similar to the mark value
	  of packets, but this mark value is kept in the conntrack session
	  instead of the individual packets.

config NF_CONNTRACK_EVENTS
	bool "Connection tracking events (EXPERIMENTAL)"
	depends on EXPERIMENTAL && NF_CONNTRACK

	  to get notified aboutchanges in the connection tracking state.

	  If unsure, say `N'.

config NF_CT_PROTO_SCTP
	tristate 'SCTP protocol on new connection tracking support (EXPERIMENTAL)'
	depends on EXPERIMENTAL && NF_CONNTRACK

	  tracking code will be able to do state tracking on SCTP connections.

	  If you want to compile it as a module, say M here and read
	  Documentation/modules.txt.  If unsure, say `N'.

config NF_CONNTRACK_FTP
	tristate "FTP support on new connection tracking (EXPERIMENTAL)"
	depends on EXPERIMENTAL && NF_CONNTRACK

	  Tracking FTP connections is problematic: special helpers are
	  required for tracking them, and doing masquerading and other forms
	  of Network Address Translation on them.

	tristate '"CLASSIFY" target support'
	depends on NETFILTER_XTABLES
	help
	  This option adds a `CLASSIFY' target, which enables the user to set

	  the connection mark value.  Similar to the MARK target, but
	  affects the connection mark value rather than the packet mark value.
	
	  If you want to compile it as a module, say M here and read
	  <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.  The module will be called

	tristate '"MARK" target support'
	depends on NETFILTER_XTABLES
	help
	  This option adds a `MARK' target, which allows you to create rules
	  in the `mangle' table which alter the netfilter mark (nfmark) field
	  associated with the packet prior to routing. This can change
	  the routing method (see `Use netfilter MARK value as routing
	  key') and can also be used by other subsystems to change their
	  behavior.
