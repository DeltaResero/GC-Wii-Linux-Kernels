The Expansion Interface (EXI)
-----------------------------

[Introductory information goes here...]


Device drivers
--------------

Outlined below is the recommended practice when writing EXI device drivers.

The bus driver already handles quite an amount of stuff, although some of
it might have to be implemented by individual device drivers. If in doubt,
see include/linux/exi.h.


Registration
------------

Declare a struct exi_driver. Initialize at least the name, id_table,
probe and remove fields:


	static struct exi_device_id frob_id_tbl[] = {
		{ .dev_id = EXI_ID_FROB0, },
		{ .dev_id = EXI_ID_FROB1, },
		{ .dev_id = EXI_ID_FROB2, },
	};

	static struct exi_driver frob_driver = {
		.name		= "frob",
		.id_table	= frob_id_tbl,
		.probe		= frob_probe,
		.remove		= frob_remove,
	};


`name' distinguishes the driver from others registered with the bus.
It should be short, unique, yet remain informative.

`id_table' is a pointer to a table of device IDs the driver claims to
support. These should be taken directly from include/linux/exi_ids.h.


`probe' is a pointer to a function that's called once the driver is bound
to a device it claims to support.

`remove' is a pointer to a function that's called when either the driver
unregisters with the bus, or a device bound to that specific driver is
physically unplugged from the bus.


From within the driver's initialization function, register the driver with
the bus by calling exi_driver_register() with the driver structure declared
previously:

	static int __init frob_init(void)
	{
		return exi_driver_register(&frob_driver);
	}


Deregistration
--------------

If the driver may be compiled as a loadable kernel module, then all you
have to do is call exi_driver_unregister() in the driver's exit function:

	static void __exit frob_exit(void)
	{
		exi_driver_unregister(&frob_driver);
	}

Device Private Data
-------------------

The functions exi_set_drvdata()/exi_get_drvdata() are available for the
sole purpose of setting and getting driver private data for an EXI device.
These are simply helpers around the driver-model functions that do the
actual work. Use them. That way, you don't have to worry (or worry less)
about changes to the driver-model API.
