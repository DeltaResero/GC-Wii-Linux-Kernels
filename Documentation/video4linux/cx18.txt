Some notes regarding the cx18 driver for the Conexant CX23418 MPEG
encoder chip:

1) The only hardware currently supported is the Hauppauge HVR-1600
   card and the Compro VideoMate H900 (note that this card only
   supports analog input, it has no digital tuner!).

2) Some people have problems getting the i2c bus to work. Cause unknown.
   The symptom is that the eeprom cannot be read and the card is
   unusable.

3) The audio from the analog tuner is mono only. Probably caused by
   incorrect audio register information in the datasheet. We are
   waiting for updated information from Conexant.

4) VBI (raw or sliced) has not yet been implemented.

5) MPEG indexing is not yet implemented.

6) The driver is still a bit rough around the edges, this should
   improve over time.
