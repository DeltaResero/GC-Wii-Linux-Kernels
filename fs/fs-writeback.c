 * Put the inode on the super block's dirty list.

 * CAREFUL! We mark it dirty unconditionally, but move it onto the

 * If it was not hashed, it will never be added to the dirty list
 * even if it is later hashed, as it will have been marked dirty already.

 * In short, make sure you hash any inodes _before_ you start marking
 * them dirty.
 *
 * This function *must* be atomic for the I_DIRTY_PAGES case -
 * set_page_dirty() is called under spinlock in several places.
 *
 * Note that for blockdevs, inode->dirtied_when represents the dirtying time of
 * the block-special inode (/dev/hda1) itself.  And the ->dirtied_when field of
 * the kernel-internal blockdev inode represents the dirtying time of the
 * blockdev's pages.  This is why for I_DIRTY_PAGES we always use
